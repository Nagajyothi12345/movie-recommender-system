# Movie Recommender System - README

# Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation system based on content filtering using the Movies and Credits dataset sourced from Kaggle. It involves data cleaning, feature extraction, preprocessing, and building a recommendation model.

# Project Structure
The project includes the following main components:

Data Cleaning: The dataset undergoes cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and standardize data formats.

Feature Extraction: Relevant features such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords are extracted from the dataset.

Preprocessing: Text and categorical data are preprocessed for feature extraction and modeling, including tokenization and one-hot encoding.

Recommendation System: A content-based recommendation system is developed using engineered features to suggest similar movies based on user preferences.
